# Extended Kalman Filter  

This is Project 1 in term 2 of the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program.  We used the starter code available [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project).

In this project we have simulated lidar and radar measurements from a car driving in a figure 8 path.  The goal is to used an extended Kalman filter to integrate these noisy measurements into an accurate estimation of the position and velocity of the car.

The project can be compiled and run as follows.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./ExtendedKF
